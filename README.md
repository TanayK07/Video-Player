Switch to branch master for the code 

If any changes let me know. 
I tried using Fonts and colour schemes close to the theme of your app. 

I could have used .env but it was a free api with no vulnerability issue. 
I used CSS in same page as it was a small project. However I do write code with more testing and better project structure
